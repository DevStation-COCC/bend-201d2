# 201: Psychological Saftey

## Overview

In addition to being a core component of the Code Fellows educational environment, psycological safety is also a key factor in making successful teams across the tech industry. 

We want our students to embody these principles, for their own enjoyment of their time with us, but also for their careers. Doing so will help them have a positive influence on their teams, their products, and their companies. 

### Preparation

Read the article assigned to the students: 

[Required Reading - What Google Learned About Teams](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

Print out a copy of this handout for every student in the class, plus 2 extra copies:

[How to Foster Psychological Saftey On Your Team](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Uag1d1kcTNOq4fRDGN1TnJVfdocNuZphD3JaTP-glo)

Keep it on the podium, upside down, until you need it. 

Of course, such a discussion should itself embody psycological safety. Ensure you are re-familiarized with the reading and the handout, so that you can model the concepts as much as possible during the discussion. 

## Lecture Structure
1. If needed, turn the lights on. Provide a warning for students before doing so. 
1. Instructor introduction:
    1. With minimal introduction, dive right in to your personal pitch
    1. Be sure it includes WHY you are in your role at Code Fellows
    1. Students have a Career Coaching assignment to develop their own pitch, so after you give yours, tell them that's an example for how to use it. 
1. Confirm students did the reading:
    1. Ask for thumbs on a sliding scale: "What percent of the reading did you get through?"
    1. Hopefully most people completed the reading. 
1. Student "Round Table" session: 
    1. Introduce the discussion exercise by letting students know what to expect.
        1. Ask students to close laptops, to focus on listening to their peers. 
        1. There is a lot of insight and experience in the room, so you want to hear from everyone. 
        1. You will "snake" around the room, starting in the front row, so everyone knows when it will be thier turn to share. 
        1. If anyone would rather, they can simply "pass".
            1. If anyone does so, always respond with minimal fuss and a smile. 
        1. You are looking to understand this new term "psychological safety". So you want to hear from students one of 3 things:
            1. In your own words, what defines psychological safety.
            1. How does your previous experience relate to the things your read?
            1. What are the results for teams who practice psychological safety?
        1. You will take notes, via the iPad, mirrored to the projected image. 
        1. The screen recording is running, and we want it to pick up everyone's comments, so you will be walking around with the mircophone to ensure voices are picked up.
        1. Ensure this is all clear, and re-iterate the 3 prompts above to get it started.
        1. Segment the iPad into 2 sections with a line down the middle. Do not label the sections at the start. 
    1. Moderate the discussion:  
        1. Your role is facilitator, not lecturer. 
            1. Your goal is to draw out and record the ideas of the students. 
            1. The exact outcome will be different every time, as cohorts will emphasize different aspects of the topic. 
        1. Casually walk to each student, with the iPad in hand.
        1. Prompt the first student (and each successive) as minimally as possible. Mostly, eye contract and a nod are sufficient. If needed: "Your thoughts?"
        1. If they introduce themselves with their names, immediately respond with, "Hi, <name>!"
        1. Actively listen to student response.
            1. Be aware of your own facial expression: alert, interested, smile, nod
            1. Be conscientious of body language: don't hover, or stand over thespeaking student; keep the mic low and close to speaker, withoutshoving it in their face. 
            1. Do not interrupt, or interject your own thoughts. Don't allowstudents to interrupt each other, they will all get a turn to speak. 
            1. Do not rush students to conclude. Give them space to speak.
            1. Identify key words or phrases that are unique to the thoughts each speaker shares. 
        1. Interactively summarize with them, in one of the following ways:
            1. Ask them to connect their thoughts to the reading
            1. In your own words, recap or restate the unique key phrase contributed 
            1. Show empathy for the student's response, especially if they describe a bad work situation. Zero in on what the causes, as they relate to the readings. 
        1. Create concise notes on the iPad describing the student's response.
            1. Summarize the key contribution in 2-3 words 
            1. Write it out on the appropriate segment of the iPad screen
            1. About half-way through the students, label the two columns with "**Actions** | **Results**". You can say, "You might have noticed i'm categorizing your comments..."
            1. As you get towards the end, the **Results** side is usually light. Ask for some help in fleshing it out. 
        1. Thank the student for their comments/sharing their story.
1. Summarize what students told you: 
    1. If no one identified $$ PROFIT $$ as a result, prompt the class as a whole: "Google dedicated hundreds of thousands of dollars, and years of researcher time to this! Why would they do that?" Take comments while filling in the **Results** column, until someone says it out loud.
    1. Ask students for a summary of the **Actions** column. "Put it all into a word or guiding principle..." We often arrive at "Be kind."
    1. Key moment: "So you are telling me, that if we just do what we were taught in kindergarten, we are going to be part of a successful, profitable, innovative, [words from board], company, where we enjoy our work, and like our team???" 
    1. Boom. 
1. Worksheet Session:
    1. Introduce the worksheet session: See directions below.
    1. Moderate the worksheet session: See directions below.
1. Conclude by kicking off the group discussion:
    1. "You know your project teams? It's time to put this all in to action."
    1. "Do you want your Project Time to be [**Result** words]?"
    1. "Gather with your team, and share with them your top strength, and as you feel comfortable, how you want to grow. You can hold each other accountable."
    1. Ask the instructor for the time to resume classroom lecture. 
    1. "You have until then, to discuss with your team, and take a break. I look forward to seeing you around."
    1. "THANK YOU!"

### Worksheet Session Setup

Provide students with a little quiet self-reflection time. 

1. "The same research team behind the findings we discussed has produced this helpful list of **tactical** steps that produce psycological safety." 
1. "Take a minute to identify your top 3 strengths, and top 3 areas where you'd like to grow."
1. "Take out a pen, and mark the line item with 'S' or 'G'."

As you give the above instructions, start slowly handing out papers to students on one side of the classroom. Say something like, "This is slow, and everyone needs one, so..." 

Then throw the entire stack of papers into the air above the middle of the classroom. They will generally spread out and drift to different students, who will continue passing extras until everyone has one. It will be a moment of fun chaos, that helps wake people up. 

Initiate the time of quiet reflection by loudly vocalizing: "OK! You have 2 minutes to scan this, and label your top 3 strengths, and your top 3 growth opportunies, go!" 

Note the time, on your phone, laptop, or watch. 

Watch the class as they make progress down the list of items. When you see the first person or two finish, give a warning of "One minute!" or "30 seconds!" depending on how it's looking like everyone else is doing. It doesn't need to be a literal 2 minutes. 

Conclude with: "Ok, I'd love to hear from you!"

### Worksheet Session Discussion Moderation

Students are generally more willing to share strengths, so start by asking, "Who would like to share one of their top stregnths?"

Take comments from 3 to 5 students, as time allows. Don't comment or elaborate on what they share, just listen, and reply with "Thanks."

Then ask, "Who would like to share an area of growth?" Hopefully, they are feeling safe enough to be vulnerable. Don't comment or elaborate on what they share, just listen, and reply with "Thanks," or "Yeah, that's hard to do!" 

Exception: If someone mentions one of the items that includes moderating team members, like "Don't interrupt, or allow interruptions", then you can respond with suggested language for doing that. "That can be tricky! But you want to be sure to let the speaker finish, and tell the interrupter: 'Let's hear out this thought, then I'd love to hear what you want to add.' or similar."

After a few people have shared growth areas, reconnect it to Project Work. Reiterate the benefits of doing these things, in terms of how it will affect their next few days, when things get stressful.
